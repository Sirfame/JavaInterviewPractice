OOP is a method of programming that uses the concept of objects. An object is a piece of code that acts as a template for other similar 
pieces of code. This is done by writing a class, which is the blueprint for the object. This class can have fields and methods, which 
can be extended and overridden by extensions of this class/object. Furthermore, when this object is reused, it can add on more fields and
more methods as needed. This is useful because programmers won't have to rewrite code every time they want to create an object, but
rather they can just extend a previously established object, and customize it as desired.
