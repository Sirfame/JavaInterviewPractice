Overriding and overloading both deal with an object's methods. Overloading happens at compile time, while
overriding happens at run time.

Overloading is when there are two methods with the same name but with different parameters.
Method overloading is also known as static polymorphism. Overloading can be done in the same class, but overriding
requires a parent and child class. 
Overriding is when a class implements a method with the same name and same parameters as its parent's
class but contains different logic than the parent class.
