I did not see your checkin for this assignment.  From my memory you did it with O(n) as you walk 
through the array entirely.  I’d like to see you improve your code by some kind of algorithm you have 
leant in the past – i.e. hint binary search.

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, 
return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. You may assume no 
duplicates in the array.
Here are few examples.
[1,3,5,6], 5 -> 2
[1,3,5,6], 2 -> 1
[1,3,5,6], 7 -> 4
[1,3,5,6], 0 -> 0
