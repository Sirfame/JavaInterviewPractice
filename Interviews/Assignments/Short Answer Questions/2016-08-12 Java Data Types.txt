There are eight primitive types:

byte - 8 bit signed two's complement integer (min -128, max 127, inclusive)
short - 16 bit signed two's complement integer (min -32,768, max 32,767, inclusive)
int - 32 bit signed two's complement integer (min -2^31, max 2^31 - 1)
long - 64 bit signed two's complement integer (min -2^63, max 2^63 - 1)
float - single precision 32 bit IEEE 754 floating point.
double - a double precision 64 bit IEEE 754 floating point.
char - single 16-bit unicode character (min '\u0000' (or 0), max '\uffff' (or 65,535))
boolean - true or false
