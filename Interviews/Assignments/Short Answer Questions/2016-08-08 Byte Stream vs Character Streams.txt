Byte stream and character streams are both streams that sequentially accesses a file.
A byte stream access the file byte by byte, while a character stream access the file character
by character. There times when it is more appropriate to use one over the other. For example,
a text file made of unicode characters should be accessed with a character stream, since 
each character is made of two bytes. If it was accessed with a byte stream, a convertion
would be required. A character stream needs to be givin the file's encoding to work properly.
Although MS word contains text, it is not a text file, and cannot be accessed with a character stream.

A stream represents a sequence of objects, usually bytes, to be accessed in sequential order.
Typical operations:

1. read one byte, next time you read, the next one is read, etc.
2. read several bytes from the stream into an array
3. seek, moving the cursor so the next time you read, it will be at that cursor position
4. write one byte
5. write several bytes from an array into the stream
6. skip bytes from the stream, which is like seek but can only go forward
7. push bytes back into the stream, next time you read will be the bytes that are pushed back.
8. peek, look at bytes without reading them.
