JDK is Java Development Kit, which is everything required to develop and run Java Applications.
JRE is Java Runtime Environment, which is everything required to run already compiled Java applications. It does not contain
the code library to develop Java Applications. 
JVM is Java Virtual Machine, which runs on top of your OS to provide a recommended Java Environment for compiled Java code.
JVM can only run bytecode, which is compiled Java Applications(.java to .class). JVM only provides the environment, it needs the Java code library
to run applications. 

JRE = JVM + required library to run app
JDK = JRE + required library to develop app

1. Java source code, by a Java developer
2. Compiled code/byte code, compiled by javac (java compiler converts code to bytecode)
3. Byte code is executed (by JVM) (Machine specific)

Bytecode can be moved anywhere (windows/linux) and executed by JVM. JVM reads bytecode and generates machine specific code. In order to 
generate machine specific code, JVM needs to be machine specific. So every type of computer (windows/linux/mac) has a specific JVM. JVM takes
care of portability.
